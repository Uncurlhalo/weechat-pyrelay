weechat-bouncer
===============

The project objective is to create a simple library for communicating with a running instance of weechat using the weechat-relay protocol.
Additionally a reference client will be built demonstrating how to create and utilize the objects presented by the library. It will also provide a simple interface with weechat allowing a remote user to send and recieve messages from their running weechat session. It will provide both SSL and IPv6 support.

weechat-pyrelay utilizes some source from QWeechat available at https://github.com/weechat/qweechat.
